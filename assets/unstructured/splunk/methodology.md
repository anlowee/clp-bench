We primarily use the default settings for single-node deployment in Splunk, with a few
modifications: we removed the event length restriction (`TRUNCATE = 0`) and configured each log line
as an individual event (`BREAK_ONLY_BEFORE_DATE = false` and `SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false`).

Data ingestion is handled using `add monitor ${datasets}`. However, we noticed a discrepancy between
the raw data size (257.25 GB) and the size ingested by Splunk (255.61 GB), resulting in a data loss
of 1.64 GB.

Upon investigation, we found that Splunk overlooked certain files during ingestion:

The total size of these files is 26.21 KB. The most of remaining of missing data is still
unaccounted for, but they have no impact on query results of the queries we use during benchmarking.
